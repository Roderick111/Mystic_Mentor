# New Features: Session & Memory Management Enhancements

## Overview
Three powerful new features have been added to enhance session and memory management capabilities:

## 1. 🧠 Memory Deletion Command

### Command: `memory clear`

**What it does:**
- Clears all memories (both short-term and medium-term) from the current session
- Keeps only the current message in conversation history
- Resets the medium-term summary
- Preserves memory settings (enabled/disabled states)

**Usage:**
```
Message: memory clear
🧠 All memories cleared from current session
```

**Benefits:**
- Fresh start within the same session
- Maintains session identity while clearing conversation history
- Useful for starting new topics without switching sessions

## 2. 🗑️ Session Deletion Command

### Command: `session delete <session_id>`

**What it does:**
- Permanently deletes a session by ID (partial ID matching supported)
- Removes session metadata file
- Cleans up associated state
- Prevents deletion of currently active session

**Usage:**
```
Message: session delete 26a7c717
🗑️ Session 26a7c717... deleted
🔄 Session state cleanup completed
```

**Safety Features:**
- Cannot delete currently active session
- Requires switching sessions first if trying to delete current one
- Partial ID matching for convenience (first 8 characters)

## 3. 💾 Session State Persistence

### **Memory Settings Preservation**

**What's Preserved:**
- Short-term memory enabled/disabled state per session
- Medium-term memory enabled/disabled state per session
- Conversation history and medium-term summaries
- Domain usage history

**Automatic Persistence:**
- Settings are saved whenever memory toggles are changed
- Settings are restored when switching to a session
- Conversation state maintained through LangGraph checkpointing

### **Enhanced Session Information**

**New `session info` display:**
```
🆔 Current Session: e9dbe8cf...
📅 Created: 2025-06-10 13:32:29
💬 Messages: 15
🎯 Domains used: ifs, lunar
🧠 Memory: ST:True, MT:True
```

## How It All Works Together

### **Session Workflow Example:**

1. **Start Session A** - Default memory settings (ST:ON, MT:ON)
   ```
   Message: memory disable short
   ✅ Short-term memory disabled
   ```

2. **Switch to Session B** - Independent memory settings
   ```
   Message: session change new
   🔄 Restored memory settings: ST:True, MT:True
   ```

3. **Return to Session A** - Settings preserved
   ```
   Message: session change <session_a_id>
   🔄 Restored memory settings: ST:False, MT:True
   🔄 Restoring conversation with 10 messages...
   ```

### **Memory Management Example:**

1. **Clear memories but keep session:**
   ```
   Message: memory clear
   🧠 All memories cleared from current session
   ```

2. **Delete unwanted sessions:**
   ```
   Message: session delete old_session_id
   🗑️ Session old_session... deleted
   ```

## Technical Implementation

### **Session Metadata Structure:**
```json
{
  "session_id": "uuid",
  "created_at": "2025-06-10T13:32:29",
  "last_activity": "2025-06-10T13:39:45",
  "message_count": 15,
  "domains_used": ["ifs", "lunar"],
  "memory_created": true,
  "memory_settings": {
    "short_term_enabled": false,
    "medium_term_enabled": true
  }
}
```

### **Persistence Mechanisms:**
- **Session Metadata**: File-based JSON storage in `data/sessions/`
- **Conversation State**: LangGraph MemorySaver checkpointing
- **Memory Settings**: Automatic save on any memory toggle command

## Benefits

### **For Users:**
- ✅ **Complete Control**: Manage memories and sessions independently
- ✅ **Session Isolation**: Each session maintains its own memory preferences
- ✅ **Persistence**: Exit and return to conversations exactly as you left them
- ✅ **Cleanup**: Remove unwanted sessions and memories easily

### **For System:**
- ✅ **Clean Architecture**: Session and memory management properly separated
- ✅ **Data Integrity**: Safe deletion with active session protection
- ✅ **Scalability**: File-based storage with efficient session switching
- ✅ **Consistency**: Memory settings preserved across application restarts

## Usage Examples

### **Complete Session Management:**
```bash
# List available sessions
Message: session list

# Switch to specific session (restores all settings)
Message: session change abc12345

# View current session details
Message: session info

# Delete old sessions
Message: session delete old_session_id
```

### **Memory Management:**
```bash
# Clear current session memories
Message: memory clear

# Toggle memory settings (automatically saved to session)
Message: memory disable medium
Message: memory enable short

# View memory status
Message: memory
```

### **Exit & Return Workflow:**
```bash
# In session A: Configure memory, have conversation
Message: memory disable short
Message: Hey, let's talk about astrology...

# Exit application
Message: exit

# Later: Restart and return to session A
python src/main.py
Message: session change abc12345
# 🔄 Restored memory settings: ST:False, MT:True
# 🔄 Restoring conversation with 15 messages...
```

## Updated Commands Reference

**New Commands:**
- `memory clear` - Clear all memories from current session
- `session delete <id>` - Delete a session by ID

**Enhanced Commands:**
- `session info` - Now shows memory settings
- `session change <id>` - Now restores memory settings
- All memory toggle commands now auto-save to session

The system now provides complete session lifecycle management with persistent memory settings, enabling seamless continuation of conversations across application restarts while maintaining full user control over memory and session management.
