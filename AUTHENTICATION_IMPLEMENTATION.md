# Authentication & Authorization Implementation

## Overview

Step 1 of the production readiness roadmap has been successfully implemented. The system now includes a comprehensive **Authentication & Authorization** system with user session isolation.

## What's Implemented ✅

### 🔐 Core Authentication System

**File: `src/core/auth_manager.py`** (300+ lines)
- **Secure password hashing**: PBKDF2-SHA256 with 100,000 iterations + random salt
- **User registration**: Username/password with validation (min 3 chars username, 6 chars password)
- **User login/logout**: Session management with last login tracking
- **File-based storage**: JSON storage with atomic writes for data integrity
- **User management**: List, delete, and admin functions

### 👤 User Session Isolation

**User-Specific Data Separation:**
- Each user gets their own SQLite database: `data/sessions/user_{username}/graph_checkpoints.db`
- Complete conversation history isolation
- Memory settings per user
- Session management per user
- Automatic cleanup on user deletion

### 🎯 Command Integration

**Authentication Commands Added:**
```bash
# User authentication
auth login              # Interactive login
auth register           # Interactive registration  
auth status             # Show current auth status
auth logout             # Logout current user

# User management (admin functions)
user register <username>    # Register user with username
user delete <username>      # Delete user and all data
user list                   # List all registered users
```

### 📋 Enhanced Logging

**New Authentication Events:**
- User registration/login/logout
- Authentication failures
- User management actions
- Debug authentication information

### 🛡️ Security Features

**Security Measures Implemented:**
- **Password hashing**: PBKDF2-SHA256 with 100k iterations
- **Salt generation**: 32-byte random salts per password
- **Input validation**: Username/password requirements
- **Session isolation**: Users can't access other users' data
- **Atomic file operations**: Prevents data corruption
- **Memory cleanup**: Secure logout and session management

## Integration Points

### 🔄 Session Manager Integration

The authentication system seamlessly integrates with the existing `UnifiedSessionManager`:

1. **Before authentication**: Uses default session database
2. **After authentication**: Switches to user-specific database
3. **Session persistence**: All user sessions and memory settings isolated
4. **Clean switching**: No data leakage between users

### 📁 File Structure

```
data/
├── auth/
│   └── users.json                    # User accounts database
└── sessions/
    ├── graph_checkpoints.db          # Default (pre-auth) sessions
    ├── user_alice/
    │   └── graph_checkpoints.db      # Alice's sessions
    └── user_bob/
        └── graph_checkpoints.db      # Bob's sessions
```

## Usage Examples

### First Time Setup

```bash
🔐 Esoteric AI Agent - Authentication Required
Commands: 'auth login', 'auth register', 'exit'

Auth> auth register
📝 User Registration
Username (min 3 chars): alice
Password (min 6 chars): [hidden]
Confirm password: [hidden]
✅ User 'alice' registered successfully

🔐 User 'alice' logged in
```

### Returning User

```bash
Auth> auth login
Username: alice
Password: [hidden]
✅ Welcome back, alice!

🤖 Esoteric AI Agent - Welcome, alice!
```

### User Management

```bash
Message: user list
👥 Registered Users:
  • alice - ✅ Active
    Created: 2025-06-10 18:30:45, Last login: 2025-06-10 18:30:50
  • bob - ✅ Active  
    Created: 2025-06-10 17:15:30, Last login: 2025-06-10 17:45:12

Message: auth status
🔐 Logged in as: alice
📅 Last login: 2025-06-10 18:30:50
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Password Security

```python
# PBKDF2-SHA256 with 100,000 iterations
hash_bytes = hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac('sha256', password_bytes, salt_bytes, 100000)
```

### User Session Path Resolution

```python
# Each user gets isolated session storage
user_path = Path(base_path) / f"user_{self.current_user.username}"
return str(user_path / "graph_checkpoints.db")
```

### Authentication Flow

1. **System starts** → Authentication required
2. **User authenticates** → Switch to user-specific database  
3. **Session operations** → All isolated to user's directory
4. **User logs out** → Clean session termination

## What's Next 📋

The authentication system provides the foundation for further production features:

- **Phase 2**: Session limits, cleanup policies, monitoring
- **Phase 3**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Phase 4**: OAuth/SSO integration
- **Phase 5**: Multi-tenant architecture

## Security Considerations

### ✅ Implemented Security Measures

- Secure password hashing (industry standard)
- User data isolation (complete separation)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Atomic file operations (prevent corruption)
- Clean session management

### 🔄 Future Security Enhancements

- Rate limiting for login attempts
- Password complexity requirements
- Session timeout policies
- Audit logging
- Two-factor authentication (2FA)

## Testing Results ✅

The authentication system has been thoroughly tested:

- ✅ User registration with validation
- ✅ Login with correct/incorrect credentials
- ✅ Session isolation verification
- ✅ User management operations
- ✅ Logout and cleanup
- ✅ File system isolation
- ✅ Command integration

**Status**: ✅ **Authentication & Authorization - COMPLETE**

This implementation provides a solid foundation for multi-user production deployment with proper security measures and user isolation.
